# Welcome to LocalWorks

## Project info

LocalWorks is a web-based marketplace designed to connect local barangay workers (such as carpenters, electricians, plumbers, and other skilled laborers) with business owners and individuals seeking services.
The platform allows workers to create profiles, showcase portfolios, receive ratings, and get matched with relevant job opportunities—supporting local economic growth, decent work, and poverty reduction.

This project is developed as an academic and community-focused system aligned with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG 8).
